### Welcome to players stats analysis with Python and Pandas.

This project utilizes a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing data from the Spanish La Liga until the 26th round. The dataset comprises over 150 columns, including statistics like goals scored, assists, shots on goal, etc. The analysis is structured into the following steps:

### Step 1: Data Imports
We begin by importing the dataset, which is regularly updated after matches.

### Step 2: Data Preprocessing
Prior to visualization, the data undergoes preprocessing tasks such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, selecting relevant columns, changing data types, and filtering.

### Step 3: Creating Variables
New columns are generated based on existing data, facilitating future visualizations.

### Step 4: Data Visualizations
Various charts are crafted to explore the dataset, aiming to uncover insights and address specific questions.

### Step 5: Problem Solving
The analysis addresses several problematic questions, attempting to provide answers and insights. Additionally, personal reflections based on the findings are included.




### Tools Used
- Jupyter Notebook: The analysis is conducted within a Jupyter Notebook environment.
- Python Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, are employed for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.

### How to Run
- To execute the analysis, simply open the Jupyter Notebook file provided and run each cell sequentially. Ensure that the required libraries are installed in your Python environment.
- Additionally, you can execute the provided Python script (`Laliga23_24_analysis.py`) directly by running:
`python Laliga23_24_analysis.py`





### Notes
